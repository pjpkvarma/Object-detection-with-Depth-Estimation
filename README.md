# Object Detection with Depth Estimation

This project develops a cost-effective and lightweight framework for object detection and depth estimation using a single camera. By integrating YOLOv5 for object detection and a custom neural network for distance estimation, the system achieves robust real-time performance. This approach eliminates the need for expensive multi-sensor setups like LiDAR, making it ideal for low-cost autonomous systems.
